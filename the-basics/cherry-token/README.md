#### What is the Cherry Token maximum supply?

There is no maximum supply of the Cherry Tokens. Each new block, a changing number of new CHER tokens are issued and distributed to the validators, stakers, treasury, and storage providers within the Cherry blockchain. This token emission will continue for the existence of the Cherry Chain as this is the means by which the network incentives its participants to act correctly.
