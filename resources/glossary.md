#### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Decentralized Finance are financial tools running on top of a decentralized ledger. For example, decentralized exchanges, lending/borrowing platforms, automated market makers (like Uniswap), and hedge funds. DeFi has the potential to replace global financial systems with a more democratic, competitive system built by a new generation of innovators.
