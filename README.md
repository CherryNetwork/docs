# Introduction

The Cherry Project is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization developing a layer one blockchain network optimized for data operations. Cherry serves as a purpose specific infrastructure for decentralized applications handling data.

## What is Cherry?

[Cherry Network](https://cherry.network) is an:

* On-chain Governed
* Nominated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Blockchain
* Smart Contract Platform
* with a WASM (WebAssembly) Runtime through Parity Substrate
* And the ability to run Rust (Ink!) Contracts
* Trustless offchain storage oracle
* compatible with the Inter Planetary File System

It is designed to apply decision-making process to the runtime of the blockchain, but also to the decision-making processes themselves, in an effort to rapidly generate more effective governance solutions for blockchain platforms.

Participants can vote, delegate, and fund improvements and upgrades through DAOs, economic mechanisms, cryptographic voting systems, and more.

Cherry users value the platform for its commitment and potential to fulfill this more decentralized and user-owned vision, both for the governance mechanisms as well as its unique token distribution mechanism which rewards network participation and validation.

**Built on Substrate**

Cherry is built on Parity Substrate, a framework for creating new blockchains derived from the Polkadot project. Substrate implements nearly all the code necessary to launch a working blockchain, including libp2p networking, a WebAssembly runtime, PBFT consensus, and clients for running nodes and proof-of-stake validators.

**Getting Involved**

Cherry is most plainly an actively-governed smart contract blockchain. Emphasis on active. Anyone can _actively…_

… deploy smart contracts to the WASM virtual machine.

… participate in council and governance decisions. With stakeholders like core devs, dapp devs, end users, chain governance, and broader community stakeholders being represented by separate councils.

… develop the protocol using skills or interest that you may have. And for those efforts, be compensated with additional CHER token — representing future staking and voting rights.



**This site,** Cherry Documentation, aims to become a community-developed resource for the use, validation, development on, and management of the Cherry smart contract platform.
